rsvndump 0.1

ABOUT
=====
rsvndump is a command line tool to dump a SVN repository
that resides on a remote server.
However, since rsvndump allows you to dump onlythere are 
quite a few differences to a normal dump:

 > Revision numbers are not synced with the remote repository
   but are simply counted, starting from 0. 
 > The url that has been specified serves as the new repository
   url. This means that it will be stripped from every directory
   and file. 


CAVEATS
=======
rsvndump is a quick hack and surely has bugs and security issues

rsvndump is very slow because every file needs to be accessed
three times (check for node type, check for properties, get
content). The first access could theoretically be merged with
one of the others, but I am too lazy right now.

Don't forget the 'tac' in 'svn -q log |tac'


NOTES
=====
SSL certificates are not being saved, so you have to accept them
everytime you run rsvndump. The same is true for usernames and
passwords.

Revision ranges or exclusion of specific revisions can be contolled
by modifying the svn log data.
